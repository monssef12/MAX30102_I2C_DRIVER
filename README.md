# MAX30102 Sensor Driver (STM32 - HAL)

This repository contains a lightweight C driver for the MAX30102 heart rate and SpOâ‚‚ sensor, designed to work with STM32 microcontrollers using the HAL library.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- I2C communication with MAX30102
- Configuration for SpOâ‚‚ and Heart Rate modes
- Reads RED and IR values from FIFO
- Supports temperature reading
- Uses 18-bit ADC data for signal processing
- UART output for debugging/logging

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### âœ… Requirements

- STM32 MCU (tested with STM32F series)
- STM32CubeMX-generated project using HAL
- I2C peripheral configured and initialized
- UART configured (optional, for debug)

## ðŸ“– How It Works

### ðŸ”„ Data Acquisition

- The MAX30102 outputs **18-bit ADC values** for RED and IR light absorption.
- The driver reads the FIFO and reconstructs full values from the 3-byte format.
- Example output:
